    "Median filtering is useful as a **smoothing technique** to reduce noice. The median filter considers each pixel in the image in turn and looks at its nearby neighbors to decide whether or not it is representative of its surroundings. Instead of simply replacing the pixel value with the mean of neighboring pixel values, it replaces it with the median of those values. The median is calculated by sorting all the pixel values from the **surrounding neighborhood** into numerical order and returning the pixel value in the middle."

    "Most morphological operations are - once again - simple kernel functions that are applied at each pixel of the image based on their neighborhood as defined by a structuring element (SE). For example, dilation simply assigns to the central pixel the maximum pixel value within the neighborhood; it is a maximum filter. Conversely, erosion is a minimum filter. Additional options emerge from combining the two: morphological closing, for example, is a dilation followed by an erosion. This is used to fill in gaps and holes or smoothing mask outlines without significantly changing the mask's area.\n",
