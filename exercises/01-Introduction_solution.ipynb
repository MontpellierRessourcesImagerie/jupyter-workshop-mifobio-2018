    "In this workshop you will learn to use jupyter notebook<cite data-cite=\"5920019/QXB8RD3Y\"></cite> to analyze bio-images that are stored in a central OMERO<cite data-cite=\"5920019/TFBN4RBU\"></cite> database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook allows to write online documents that contain text, equations, graphics, images and executable code in different programming languages including python and R. They provide therefore a good medium for exploring and teaching image and data analysis. Beyond teaching and exploration they could be used to make the image and data analysis parts of scientific publications reproducible. In this context the images can be stored in an OMERO database and accessed from the jupyter notebook -- independent from where it runs, locally on your machine, on a server at your institution or in a hosted environment. \n"
